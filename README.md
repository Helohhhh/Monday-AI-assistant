MONDAY AI

This is a AI developed by Abhishek Meena. It uses many modules like openai, num2words, wikipedia ect. This was entirely done in Python

NOTE: you need your openai key to let this work, and you can customize this however you want.
This may seem like a simple project, but it is very special to me. It had too many bugs for me to fix (yup i am a beginner) soo... :) enjoy.
